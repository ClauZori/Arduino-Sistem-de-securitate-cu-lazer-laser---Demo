# Laser-security-system---Demo

The main purpose of the laser security system is to ensure effective monitoring of the protected area against intruders or unauthorized disturbances. It must provide a quick and efficient response to the detection of any changes in the laser beam, thus ensuring the security of the location.

# Functionality of the project:
If the laser beam is interrupted (the sensor no longer sees the laser light), the system triggers an audible and visual warning, lighting up the red LED and generating a warning sound with the buzzer. Instead, when the sensor senses the return of the laser beam (the presence of light), the system returns to normal, turning on the green LED and turning off the warning sound. Thus, the system reacts to interruptions or disturbances of the laser beam to indicate changes in the security status of the monitored area.
